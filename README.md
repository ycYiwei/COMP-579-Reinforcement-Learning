# COMP-579-Reinforcement-Learning

Independently completed all assignments for McGill's reinforcement learning course taught by Prof. Doina Precup.

## Assignment 1
Experimented with the k-armed bandit problem. 

## Assignment 2
Implemented and compared the performance of SARSA and expected SARSA on the Frozen Lake domain from OpenAI Gym;
Implemented and compared the performance of Q-learning and actor-critic with linear function approximation on the cart-pole problem.

## Assignment 3
Experimented with offline RL: ran the Q-learning agent from assignment 2 (the expert) and a random agent on the cart-pole problem and gathered 500 behavioral episodes for each; trained imitation learning and fitted Q-learning on each dataset and compared the results.
